 - **Git config**: `git config --global user.name "Dominik Stuerzer"` to set the name, analogously the e-mail. Check status by `git config --list`.
 - Set up **credential cache**: `git config --global credential.helper cache` stores remote login data for a while.
 - **Initalize** Git on the local machine: `git init`.
 - **Clone** from other repo: `git clone` initializes and clones the repo. 
 - **Status**: `git status` shows status of files in repo. Short version with flag `-s`.
 - **Basics**: Fist time `git add` tracks files. At all times `git add` *stages* a file. `git commit` takes a snapshot of the *staging area*. Unstaged changes will not be committed (even if correspoding file is staged). `git commit -v` puts diff of change in the editor. The flag `-a` stages all tracked files and commits them - it skips the `add`-part.
 - **Remove** a file: `git rm` stages the deletion of a file, the next commit deletes it. However, it can still be checked out in past commits.
 - **Rename**: A file can be renamed by `git mv <old_name> <new_name>`, the namechange is then staged.
 - **Untrack** a file by `git rm --cached <file>`: it is removed from staging area, and not tracked any more. If a previously committed file is untracked, checking out past commits will result in a conflict.
 - **Unstage**: To undo a `git add <file>` (i.e. remove it from the stagin area), use `git reset HEAD <file>`.
 - **Unmodify** a file: `git checkout -- <file>` overwrites file in working directory with last commited version. *Danger*: Any changes since last commit will be lost!
 - **Diff (1)**: running simply `git diff` shows the diff between working directory and staging area (i.e. still unstaged changes). If nothing has been staged since last commit, `git diff` shows the diff between last commit and working directory. Adding the flag `--staged`, it shows the diff between last commit and staging area.
 - **Log**: Possible flags: `-p` shows difference introduced in each commit. `-<n>` limits output to past `n` commits. `--stat` shows change stats. `--graph` shows branches. `--relative-date` show relative date.
 - **Amend**: `git commit --amend` adds currently staged changes to your last commit, and you can edit the last commit message. You don't get a new commit. 
 - **Remote branches**: `git pull` is `git fetch`, followed by a `git merge` from the branch your local branch is *tracking*. Tracking    means that the remote branch and the local branch are 'connected'.
 - *Initializing tracking branch*: push local branch to tracking branch on the remote by `git push -u origin <local_branch>:<remote_branch_name>`
  - *Fetching* remote branch: If there is a remote branch <rbranch>, and I want to create a local branch tracking the remote, you do `git checkout --track origin/<rbranch>`, or more quickly, `git checkout <rbranch>`
 - **Remotes**: Show all remotes by `git remote -v`, and delete a remote by `git remote rm <origin>`
